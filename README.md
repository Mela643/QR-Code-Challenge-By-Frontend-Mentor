## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I like to be honest. I began learning web development earlier this month and to be frank, I didn't find the challenge easy. I had to copy some codes from Khali completed challenge (2-3 lines). Although I copied the code, i'm glad i was able to learn from it.
Here are some codes I'm proud to have learnt
```css
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
}
```
### Continued development

Forms has been one of my major problems since starting out.
I have quite a few times where I'd get frustrated. I'm hoping to get to understand it to the level i want to. Of course, with more practice.
